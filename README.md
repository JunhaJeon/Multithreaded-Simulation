# Multithreaded Simulation
This project simulates a system of resources and systems, with each system consuming and producing resources. The simulation involves a manager that oversees and adjusts system operations based on events, while handling multithreading and synchronization using semaphores to manage shared resources.

The simulation is designed to run in multiple threads: one for each system and one for the manager. The systems produce and consume resources, generating events that are handled by the manager. The manager processes these events to adjust system speeds and terminate the simulation when certain conditions are met.

# Features
Makefile: Automates the build process, ensuring only modified files are recompiled.
Dynamic Memory Management: Uses malloc, calloc, and free() for allocating and deallocating memory for systems, resources, and event queues.
Event Queue: A priority-based linked list for queuing and processing events generated by systems.
Multithreading: Uses pthread to run each system and the manager in their own threads.
Synchronization: Utilizes semaphores (sem_t) to synchronize access to shared resources and event queues between threads.

# Files
Makefile: Builds the project and handles dependencies.
defs.h: Header file containing function declarations, data structures, and semaphore initialization.
event.c: Implements the event queue and functions for managing events.
main.c: The entry point of the program that initializes the simulation and creates threads.
manager.c: Handles the manager thread, which processes events from the queue.
resource.c: Manages resources, including creation, destruction, and dynamic memory management.
system.c: Implements the system structure, running the system threads, and modifying resources.

## Building and Running
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing the program's files.
2. Type the command to compile the program: 'make'
3. You should see a new executable file named 'p2' in the directory.
4. From that directory, you can run the program with:'./p2'

# Requirements
GCC compiler
POSIX threads library (pthread)
Semaphore support (sem_t)

# Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, the following skills were applied:
Writing and using a Makefile to compile separate source files into object files and link them into an executable.
Managing dynamic memory for collection structures (using malloc, calloc, and free).
Using pthreads for multithreading and semaphores for synchronizing data between threads.
Implementing a priority-based event queue using a linked list.
